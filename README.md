# AniHome (WIP)

AniHome is another anime tracker for the website [AniList](https://anilist.co/home).

The initial design of the app was made using figma: [View-only link](https://www.figma.com/design/Jib1ciye53Igwcx2xYl54d/AniHome?node-id=7-767&t=egdyqKlmfRQ6wp9K-1)

It has the following list of features:
- Show the most popular anime & manga
- View detailed information of specific anime & manga
- Look up anime & manga
- Track your anime & manga

Since, it's a WIP it has the following issue or missing features:
- ~~"Upcoming next season" doesn't display anything~~
- Fix scrolability of the body of a review
